2024–Present
Operated at the intersection of DevOps, software development, and systems integration, serving as a lead contributor on multiple

wide-scale initiatives. Played a pivotal role in modernizing infrastructure, improving CI/CD workflows, and transitioning mission-
critical systems and processes from legacy to modern tooling. Acted in cross-functional roles including developer, infrastructure

engineer, DevSecOps strategist, trainer, and project lead.
Project: Bitbucket to GitLab Enterprise Migration
Position: Lead Developer, Migration Architect, Enablement Lead

analysis to full deployment.
• Created fully containerized test environments integrating Jira, GitLab, and Jenkins to validate cross-platform workflows
before migration.
• Authored a custom migration toolchain that automated repo transfers, Jenkins pipeline conversions, and credential
handling, drastically reducing human effort and error.
• Conducted market research and evaluation of available GitLab features and integration capabilities, including GitLab’s
native Jira connectors.

• Facilitated successful onboarding for 20+ development teams by delivering live training sessions, designing self-guided
onboarding materials, and hosting Q&A workshops.
• Centralized and versioned all CI/CD documentation on GitLab Pages to support self-service and reduce reliance on
tribal knowledge.
• Developed and deployed CI templates and reusable pipeline modules in GitLab CI, which now serve as the foundation
for container builds, code scans, and testing pipelines across multiple departments.
Project: DRIP (Duplicate Record Identification Program)
Position: Lead Architect and Full-Stack Developer
• Designed and implemented DRIP, an ML-powered data quality platform that identifies potential duplicates across
internal records using semantic comparison.
• Built a performant frontend using Next.js and a standards-compliant backend using FastAPI, complete with interactive
testing UI and OpenAPI schema definitions.
• Engineered a modular data ingestion pipeline for extracting and transforming data from SQL databases, Jira, and Word
files, optimizing them for Elasticsearch and LLM processing.
• Integrated transformer-based LLMs (e.g., msmarco-MiniLM-L-12-v3, multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1) via Eland to
semantically compare indexed records in Elasticsearch.
• Implemented background processing and job queuing using Celery and Redis, improving responsiveness and user
experience during compute-intensive operations.
• Used Logstash and Kibana for centralized logging, monitoring, and visualizing duplicate detection accuracy and data
ingestion rates.
• The DRIP platform was later leveraged to prototype an enterprise-wide Elastic Monitoring solution, significantly
expanding its organizational value.
Project: Elastic Monitoring Solution for CI/CD Pipelines
Position: Lead Integrator and Infrastructure Engineer
• Repurposed DRIP components to deploy a production-grade Elastic Stack cluster on the unclassified network.
• Centralized CI/CD logs across multiple Jenkins nodes, providing unified visibility into the Martin Standard Pipeline.
• Enabled real-time alerting, error tracing, and root cause diagnostics across build, test, and deployment stages.
• Advocated for adoption of Elastic Monitoring at the enterprise level, demonstrating measurable gains in triaging
efficiency and pipeline health reporting.
Project: Internal Search Engine
Position: Lead Developer and Integrator
• Forked and customized SearxNG, an open-source meta search engine, to aggregate and rank results from internal data
systems and Confluence.
• Integrated internal APIs and custom plugins to make institutional knowledge and engineering resources easily
discoverable across disparate tools.
• Ensured authentication compliance and performance tuning for use within classified and unclassified networks.
Project: Auto-Documentation and Knowledge Continuity System
Position: Automation Engineer
• Developed a GitLab CI workflow using LLMs and metadata introspection to generate high-quality README.md
documentation for source code repositories.
• Published results automatically to internal knowledge bases, reducing onboarding time and knowledge silos.
Project: Platform Upgrade - RHEL 6 to RHEL 8 Migration
Position: Build Engineer
• Upgraded build infrastructure and Maven targets to ensure compatibility with RHEL 8, modernizing legacy software
stacks.
• Automated build configuration updates and system checks using Ansible, ensuring reliability and reproducibility across
multiple dev environments.
• Modularized builds to improve portability and isolate legacy dependencies for long-term maintainability.
